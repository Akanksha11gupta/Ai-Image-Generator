Text to AI Image Generator
This is a simple and responsive web app that converts text prompts into AI-generated images using the Hugging Face Inference API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to:

Choose from multiple AI models (like Stable Diffusion, SDXL, etc.)

Select the number of images to generate (1–4)

Set aspect ratios like 1:1, 16:9, or 9:16

Download images with a single click

No backend is required — it's fully client-side. Just add your Hugging Face API key in the script and run the app in your browser. Ideal for quick image generation, prototyping, or educational demos.
